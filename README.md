# CLAASP: A Cryptographic Library for the Automated Analysis of Symmetric Primitives

_WARNING: this package has been anonymized for the purpose of blind review. 
Information about the authors, their affiliations and license related statements have been removed.
The content of this package remains confidential and for review only._


This package is designed as a sofware tool to automate as much as possible the analysis of the design of symmetric primitives 
such as block ciphers, cryptographic permutations, hash functions, and stream ciphers, from a cryptanalytic point of view.
It is built on the top of [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org) and
implemented using [Python3](https://www.python.org/).
