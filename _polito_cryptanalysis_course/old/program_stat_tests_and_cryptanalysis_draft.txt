Day 0 - Bitslice AES [@paul]

Cryptanalysis
Day 1 [@ema]
- intro to permutation and block ciphers
- 1/2/3 bit block cipher
- description of main toy ciphers
  + 6 bits
    * 2 3-bit sboxes spn (different sboxes)
    * Speck b6k6 (different rotations)
    * 6 bit feistel
  + 8 bit ciphers
    * 2 4-bit sboxes spn (different sboxes)
    * Speck b8k8 (different rotations)
    * 8 bit feistel
  + 16 bit ciphers
    * 4 3-bit sboxes spn (different sboxes)
    * Speck b16k16 (different rotations)
    * 16 bit feistel
    * 2x2 ChaCha b16k8
  + 20? bit ciphers
    * BipBip https://tches.iacr.org/index.php/TCHES/article/view/9955
  + other ciphers? 
    * Mini AES

      https://piazza.com/class_profile/get_resource/ixlc30gojpe5fs/iyv0273azwtz4
    * Heys Cipher
    * Small AES
    * Mini DES

  + show slide attacks in the case of the same key for each round (same round key)
  + we will use a linear key schedule 
    * rotation at each round
    * key plus a constant (variant of slide attack)
  + nonlinear key schedule as in speck
  + one random independent key for each round (higher security?)
- Brute Force of toy ciphers
- Introduction to CLAASP
- Feistels needs certain number of rounds


Day 2 [@ema]
- Meet in the middle
- Collision Search / vanOrschot-Wiener

Day 3 - Statistial tests for block ciphers [@cs]
- translating the paper of SECITC to slides and applied to the toy ciphers

Day 4 - Avalanche Tests [@mohamed]
- first and high order avalanche tests
- translating the paper of Africacrypt to slides and applied to the toy ciphers

Day 5 6 - 
  Differential Cryptanalysis [@raghav]
  wide and long trail strategy
  number of active sboxes

  Linear Cryptanalysis [@raghav]

  Advanced Differential/Linear Cryptanalysis and variants [@raghav]

Day 7 - Neural Network based cryptanalysis [@david]
- black box distinguisher
- neural aided distinguishers (2 tests in the library)

Day 8 - Algebraic Cryptanalysis [@sharwan/@rusydi]
- goal would be to 
  + explain how to model a cipher as a system of Boolean polynomials
  + compute cipher pre-image (find key and message, find key given message) given the output (ciphertext)
  + division property? high order?

Models 9 [@juan]
- goal
  + explain how to model the toy ciphers to find xor linear and differential trails with MILP and CP (minizinc)
  + mention SAT and SMT but not go into details
