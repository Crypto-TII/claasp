"""CryptoMiniSat model of Cipher.

.. _cms-deterministic-truncated-standard:

CMS Deterministic Truncated XOR Differential of a cipher
------------------------------------------------------------

The target of this class is to override the methods of the superclass
:py:class:`Sat Deterministic Truncated Xor Differential Model
<cipher_modules.models.sat.sat_models.sat_deterministic_truncated_xor_differential_model>`
to take the advantage given by the handling of XOR clauses in CryptoMiniSat SAT solver. Therefore,
the internal format for SAT CNF clauses follows 4 rules (3 from the superclass +
1):

    * every variable is a string with no spaces nor dashes;
    * if a literal is a negation of a variable, a dash is prepended to the
      variable;
    * the separator for literals is a space;
    * the string ``'x '`` is prepended to a clause representing a XOR.

Note that only methods that do not need to introduce new variables to handle
XOR operations were overridden.

For any further information, visit `CryptoMiniSat - XOR clauses
<https://www.msoos.org/xor-clauses/>`_.
